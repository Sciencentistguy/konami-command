**ARE YOU RAYDEE TO AUGMENT YOUR BORWSING ?** (with userjs, user javascript, 
greasemonkey, **userscripts**, etc.)

**YES ?**

Here are my small **multi‐browser** user scripts.
Mostly for [MusicBrainz](https://musicbrainz.org).


HOW TO INSTALL
--------------

Please install all your scripts from this GitHub page.

Click on a script to review its description and code, then 
Click on **Raw** button to install.

You can start by installing [INSTALL-USER-SCRIPT](https://github.com/jesus2099/konami-command/blob/master/INSTALL-USER-SCRIPT.user.js) 
which adds a direct download/install ![monkey](https://github.com/violentmonkey/violentmonkey/raw/1d911bffd7d4c37f82b5bcdada16f0b79fe0a70a/src/public/images/icon16.png) **monkey** icon button in front of each userscripts 
in github, gitlab and bitbucket file listings.


COMPATIBILITY
-------------

There are 3 userscript engines that I know:

- Greasemonkey: Open source pioneer
- [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io): Open source multi-browser
- Tampermonkey: Closed source

I advise Violentmonkey as it works in every browsers consistently and is open source.
Unfortunately, Greasemonkey has had several outstanding issues since version 4+ and only works in Firefox.

For information, here are setups that I use most (as of 2021-03-15):

- [Firefox](https://mozilla.org/firefox) on Linux, Android (FF v68) and Windows + [Violentmonkey][vm-ff]
- [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com) on Windows + [Violentmonkey][vm-ch]
- Chromium on Raspberry Pi 3B+ OS Raspbian + [Violentmonkey][vm-ch]

As Vivaldi is based on Chromium, it also works in Chrome.
I have been told it also works in Safari.
Please report bugs if it does not work in your setup (see next section).
